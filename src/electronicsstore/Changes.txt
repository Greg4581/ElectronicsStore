Minor changes to remove compiler warnings and possible unsafe procedures:
-Made set-member functions final where applicable
-Added @Override notation for toString method in Account.java
-Made Inventory and Account classes abstract
-Made inventoryList final (adding and deleting objects is still allowed but inventoryList cannot be re-assigned)
-Made all varibles and functions static in Inventory.java
-Removed constructors in Inventory.java
-Removed redundant 'StoreObject' specification from the diamond inference <> in Inventory.java and StandardAccount.java assignments in constructors
-Used enhanced for loop in getHistory function in StandardAccount.java (easier to read)

Other minor changes:
-Changed 'gender' to char data type instead of string
-Removed default constructor in StoreObject.java as it served no functional purpose

Final changes:
-Updated addToInventory function to handle adding an item that already exists (updates quantity)
-Added a specific 'equals' function that returns true if the items being compared have the same itemNumber
-Added a 'copy' function to StoreObject.java
-Added a 'getItem' function to Inventory.java
-Added a test implentation in the main java file "ElectronicsStore.java" to test the new functions
